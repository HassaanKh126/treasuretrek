# 🗺️ Treasure Trek

Treasure Trek is a simple geocaching-inspired web app where players compete to find hidden treasures.  
The host sets up the game by adding objects, their descriptions, and point values.  
Participants join the game, and once it starts, they hunt for treasures.  
The player with the most points at the end wins! 🎉

## 📖 How It Works
1. **Host creates the game**

   - Press **Add** to save them to the game  
   - Once ready, press **Host the Game**

2. **Players join**
   - Participants connect to the game lobby
   - Wait until the host starts the game

3. **Game time**
   - Players find treasures and collect points
   - The leaderboard updates as treasures are found

4. **Winner**
   - The player with the highest score at the end wins 🏆


## AI Usage
This project is made completely by me, a little... i mean absolutely little use of AI is done like in generating this Readme file. Also when I get completely stuck, happened only 2 times. I used it to ask stuff like how do we find an object based on properties from a list or why socket.io is not working on vercel, turns out it don't work on vercel so i deployed the backend to Railway. it comes at 6 to 8 percent AI Usage.

## More Notes:
This is web app, the main fun remains, i will be working on the android app, that will be THE FUN (ia).
